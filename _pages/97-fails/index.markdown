## 97 - Fractal Analytics



[LeaderBoard Rank 129/211](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/fractal-analytics-hiring-hackathon/lb)



#### _Goal_



Goal is to find the severals items demands using their historical demands. For some items, they share some common category, sub-categorical info. Tricky part is not all items have simmilar historical data, some have 9 months data and while others have only few weeks of data and we have predict 60 days into future.



#### _Issues I had_







  * Lack of proper testing framework or model.


  * Lack of knowledge on Time-Series Models. Example ARIMA.


  * Lack of experience of time series modelling.





#### _Learning Sources_



Time Series Analysis





  * [Econometrics - Ani Katchova](https://sites.google.com/site/econometricsacademy/econometrics-models/time-series-arima-models): Ani, convers the most part of theoritical Knowledge to understand and have a quick start in Time-Series Analysis. No Code - Just Theory.



  * [Econometrics Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw77aMLj9uM&list=PLz1cztQeF4YlEOn8IGY7hT39wa2Tg-XcM&index=3): A bit abractly conveys understanding of AR, MA, ARMA and ARIMA, a bit deeper understanding. No Py Code - Just Theory.



  * [PyData Conf - Jeffrey Yau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ-O3hk1vRw&list=PLz1cztQeF4YlEOn8IGY7hT39wa2Tg-XcM&index=4): Theory + Hands on Code. Lots of Python Notebooks also available in [Github](https://github.com/silicon-valley-data-science/pydata-sf-2016-arima-tutorial).



  * [PyCon 2017 - Aileen Nielsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmfe2RaX-14&list=PLz1cztQeF4YlEOn8IGY7hT39wa2Tg-XcM&index=5): Complete Set. Theory + Basics + little Math + Code + Nice Notebooks in [Github](https://github.com/AileenNielsen/TimeSeriesAnalysisWithPython)
