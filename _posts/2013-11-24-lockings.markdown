ORACLE LOCKINGS

    
    
    -- FOR LOCKED OBJECTS
    SELECT ORACLE_USERNAME
        OS_USER_NAME,
        LOCKED_MODE,
        OBJECT_NAME,
        OBJECT_TYPE
    FROM V$LOCKED_OBJECT LO,DBA_OBJECTS DO
    WHERE LO.OBJECT_ID = DO.OBJECT_ID;
    
    -- FOR LOCKED USERS
    SELECT S.USERNAME,
        S.SID,
        L.TYPE,
        L.LMODE,
        L.REQUEST
    FROM V$LOCK L, V$SESSION S
    WHERE L.SID = S.SID;
    
    SELECT USERNAME, 
        ACCOUNT_STATUS, 
        LOCK_DATE 
    FROM DBA_USERS 
    WHERE USERNAME='ALEX';
    




Query the "v$locked_object" table for additional information about what is locked. Join with the "dba_objects" table for name and type. The object name indicates what is locked and the username columns identify who has created the lock.
