I never knew that something good can also be messy!! I am talking Django 1.8 web framework. After being inspired by my mentor,.. actually got bugged/ bored & tired of sluggish web development portal I have finally decided to take it with Django 1.8

Like any noob I have started off with downloading Django 1.8 possible latest version. May be I should have taken a step back and thought of learning with one stable version which has a lot of tutorials !!

To all those who are very new & want to start-off with Django,. here are some links & tips.



	
  * Best is to start-off completing the Django Part 1 to Part 5 tutorial

	
  * Second best, if you have mentor/tried Django earlier and want to learn a bit more start off with [DjangGirls](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_start_project/README.html)

	
  * Here are some example

	
    * CRUD - Create Read Update Delete forms & other
