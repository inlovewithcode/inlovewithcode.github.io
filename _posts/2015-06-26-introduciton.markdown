Data Science is the Science for extraction of knowledge from large volumes of data.

Data can structured formats like databases, excel sheets, log files or unstructured formats like email, blogs post comments or online discussions.

Data scientists use the ability to
- find and interpret rich data sources;
- manage large amounts of data despite hardware, software, and bandwidth constraints;
- merge data sources;
- ensure consistency of datasets;
- create visualizations to aid in understanding data;
- build mathematical models using the data; and
- present and communicate the data insights/findings (preferably actionable insights) to specialists and scientists in their team and if required to a non-technical audience.


#### History


In 1960 by Peter Naur, initially used term -"data science"/"datalogy" as a substitute for computer science.

In 1974, Peter Naur published _Concise Survey of Computer Methods_, which freely used the term data science in its survey of the contemporary data processing methods that are used in a wide range of applications.

In 1996, members of the International Federation of Classification Societies (IFCS) met in Kobe for their biennial conference. Here, for the first time, the term data science is included in the title of the conference ("Data Science, classification, and related methods")
