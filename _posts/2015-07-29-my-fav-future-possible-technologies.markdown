#### AUGMENTED REALITY


Augmented Reality refers to the ability to overlay information to a live video feed of the world. Google glass is one such technology where a user can connect his surrounding to internet on demand to learn and understand more. This helps in tuning information which anyone can access to many small activities like how to make a coffee or wrap a gift or how to find you way back home or translation any foreign text on spot.

#### ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE


ASIMO 2000
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. In its practical manifestation it impacts through smart appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, ovens, industrial robots etc), web search, online businesses such as Amazon.com, friendly avatars, games and toys. Recall the chess-playing program Deep Blue developed by IBM that beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. One of the remarkable advances in AI is the machine's ability to learn from a huge amount of data to do tasks such as human language translation, face recognition, financial forecasting, road traffic control, medical decision making, etc.
ASIMO, an acronym for Advanced Step in Innovative MObility, is a humanoid robot designed and developed by Honda. ASIMO has the ability to recognize moving objects, postures, gestures, its surrounding environment, sounds and faces, which enables it to interact with humans. The robot interprets voice commands and human gestures, enabling it to recognize when a handshake is offered or when a person waves or points, and then respond accordingly.

#### QUANTUM TELEPORTATION/ ENTANGLEMENT


Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated or interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently – instead, a quantum state may be given for the system as a whole.

In easy words, Quantum teleportation refers to the direct transfer of a quantum state(information) from one location to another, making possible the out of the ordinary phenomenon dubbed as “entanglement”. This phenomenon is the link that exists between certain particles even when they are separated by space.
If, as Moore's Law states, the number of transistors on a microprocessor continues to double every 18 months, the year 2020 or 2030 will find the circuits on a microprocessor measured on an atomic scale. And the logical next step will be to create quantum computers, which will harness the power of atoms and molecules to perform memory and processing tasks. Quantum computers have the potential to perform certain calculations significantly faster than any silicon-based computer.
