Here is a code translator for converting a python code to JS code. After getting so much used to python, it might be a bit difficult to go back to JS Code, but this python module can help us a bit once we get used to it I guess.


##### 




##### How to install ?


You can use pip to install this Py to JS translator

# `pip install pythonscripttranslator`




##### How does this work?


Lets first create a small hello word python script

`echo 'print "Héllo World"' > app.py`

Once you have the script, you just need to do following

`pythonscript < app.py > app.py.js`
