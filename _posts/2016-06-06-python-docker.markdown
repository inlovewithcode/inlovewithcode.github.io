If do not know much about Docker, then here is a simple explanation I have for you.


#### **Docker**


Portable Application Virtualization.



	
  * Gives similar results independent of OS Envir

	
  * Works like VM Images. Miniature VM, just for an Application.

	
  * Lightweight containers, with all batteries loaded/libraries attached at once.


Once you have basic **docker system** is ready, you can **dock** anything you got. Every dock is its own, no dependency on your OS or other dockers. More like **Plug and Play**.

In BSD we have a similar approach but in layman terms, this is what is called a Docker or a Jail does.

I found this article that explains how to use python as docker for Data Science. So good luck fellows.
