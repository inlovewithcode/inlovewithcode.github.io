* Easy to Read*/Learn/Maintain
* Interpreter/ Compiler # Interpreter is easy & quick to learn
* Portable Language - Mac/Windows/Linux/
* Extendable Language - File Ops/ Data Ops/REST ops/..
* Database Interface
* GUI Programming - you build Websites/Desktop apps
* Scalable?
    (NO)
    * GIL - Global Interpreter Lock - prevents multithreading
    * No native Cloud support
    
    (Alternatives)
    
    * Lots of packages written in C/C++ & Java/Scala(Pandas, Numpy, Scikit).
    * `Py4JS` packages help you to work with Spark.
    * `Dask` package - multinode & multicore task scheduling.
    * `MPI4PY` package - data serialization for data distrubuted computing.

* Speed?
    * Natively is not so much compared to C/Java/Scala/C++.
    (Alternatively)
    * Theano
    * PyPi
    * Numba
    
    On top of everything, most mission critical jobs in Python packages are written in C/C++ and python wrapper are provided & they are easy to use.

> Pythonâ€™s speed problems are not because it is not Java or C - the reference implementation CPython is C. The problem is that Python code is difficult to optimise, because everything is mutable. Almost everything is evaluated at runtime, and side-effects can happen at any time.


Python VS Java

* Python - 1989 started
* Python SOftware Foundation - PSF - sponser group.
* Python - 1991 First release
* Guido Van Rossum

Java
* Sun Micro System/Oracle
* 1995 First relase.
* James Gosling.



Java - **statically typed** programming language.
        => types should be defined explicitly. # other wise error - complie time.
Java - Complie time errors.
        * Syntactical errors.
        * Variable Declarations Errors.
