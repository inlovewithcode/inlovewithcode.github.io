Procedural
- step by step building things


Classes, Interaction Descriping, Blue Prints,

OOP Maps your mtal model to code.

Python Give A LOT of freedom

* One-off Scripts
* Frameworks & libraries
* Games & applications

# Design Principles

## Solid Principles (Uncle bob martin)

* [S]Single Responsiblity Principle.
	* Break a larger object to smaller ones
	* Use Mixin to maintain Single Responsiblility Feature

* [O]Open/Close Principle
	* Code should open to extension but closed to modification

* [L]Liskov Susitutability Principle
	* (DuckTypying) Do use subclasses for a functionality tthat was not purpose of its base class

* [I]Interface Segregation Principle
	* Method is not being used? remove it.
	* How many methods are being used.

* [D]Dependency Inversion Principle
	* High Level modules should not depend on Low level
	* both should depend on abstractions

Bonus Learning

* Tell, Dont ask
  * Tell objects to do the work , dont ask them(for data)

> Think in object, objects can express domain
